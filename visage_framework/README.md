# Visage
A framework inspired by HTML for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) inside modern terminals.

**This project is currently work-in-progress** (dont use)

## Anticipated features (hopefully (maybe))
- Basic HTML elements (div, input, button)
- Dynamic updates and efficient rerendering
- Event handler system (keyup, keydown, resize?, etc.)
- Flexible CSS-like style definitions
- React-like components
- Automatically managed component tree which can be navigated with tab/arrow keys

Usage/examples will maybe probably be added here as features get polished.
