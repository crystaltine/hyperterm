# Final feedback

## Overall score: 10/10

Wow, you guys started off with crazy high ambitions, and even though you didn't
manage to implement everything you wanted, you covered a lot of ground. I have
to confess, I wasn't able to run the program at home, but I'm looking forward
to the demo! I'm especially eager to play Geometry Dash. Looking through the
code, I get the impression you guys really went to town on it.

Thanks for the detailed writeup in the Google doc. Having a narrative of what
happened makes it much easier for me to understand. I'm very impressed with how
much thought and effort you put into the architecture.

One thing to think about for future git projects: you can all do a better job
of curating your commits to be understandable later. At the point the next
skill to learn is to squash your commits before putting them up for PR. You
many have developed a new feature in tiny steps, each of which was originally a
separate commit. But when you ask for a code review, how much of that does the
reviewer need to know about? By squashing things you can create a (fictitous)
history that breaks down your steps cleanly. Also, this will help you avoid
checking in merge nodes.

## Specific callouts

* Lucas, it was fun to watch you go through all the pain and excitement of
  getting the client-server communication working to the point where you can
  have three-way voice chats. Good job persevering!
* Michael, I agree with the comment in your self-reflection that you had a
  repeat of the previous project. For example, it looks like you obliterated
  all of Vaibhav's contributions to the menu? I know it's hard for you to
  relate, but you need to think through what that feels like from his
  perspective. Your prodigious amount of work is wildly impressive, of course,
  but to work with other people you need to let them have their space too. The
  solution to your conundrum is to adopt the mindset that you can't control all
  parts of the app. But in the parts that you do control, there's still so much
  room to contribute that you never need to feel limited. You can add more
  value by writing new stuff than by rewriting code that already exists, even
  if you think it could be written better.
* Reshil, I'm only seeing six small commits from you since sprint 2. Am I
  missing something?
* Ben, it looks like you hardly checked in anything since sprint 2? What
  happened??
