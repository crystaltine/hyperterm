# Viscord Information 

**Database**

  -The Database is written using PostSQL and consists of several tables such as UserInfo, MemberInfo, SeverInfo, etc. Each table contains various columns, each which hold a specific data necessary to make our viscord app function similarly to its inspiration: Discord 
  
  -Throughout the backend code, we communicate with this PostSQL Database in order to fetch, select, and send data. In order to make sure the database is running properly and getting updated as it recieves queries and calls, we will always fill up the database with prewritten data.
